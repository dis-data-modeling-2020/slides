# Results of Assignment 1

## Common mistakes

### A1E1
* Markdown: No difference between question and answer. Just one line of text. 
* Too short answers (single word answers are not enough!)
* Style: Lists in lists need an indent
* Submit *Markdown* not *HTML*
* No whitespace after markdown commands
* Do not use non-standard or "invented" markups like `->`
* While a mix of HTML and Markdown is possible it should be avoided!!
* Use of Markdown to *format* but not to *structure* the document
* Trying to "overstyle" Markdown documents (list in codeblock with emphasize markup and even more...)
 
### A1E2
* No verbatim code formatting
* Formating code blocks with ">" and excesive indents
* RTFM - Read `introduction.md` NOT `*.md`
* Missing console print of line.txt
* `cat | wc -l ` doesn't do the trick...

### A1E3
* to few actions (only 2-3)
* no merge
* have a look on a common and sane naming schema!

### A1E4
* comments and code don't match
* sort in E4.5 is missing
* ISSN codes can include an X
* `.{4}-.{4}` is to generic
* $ doesn't belong in the .sh file! (1 point malus for exercise 1)
* regex have to be consistent - don't use `\d{4}` first and later `\d\d\d\d`
* whitespace between `*` and `.tsv` (0.5 point malus)
* Spellchecking! 
* Don't pipe everything to cat at the end. That's not necsessary
* `sort -u| uniq -u` -> double dipping
* `\d{1,4}` - don't use min,max

### A1E5
* description of data fields too short
* document working steps on a more abstract level, do not report every button click, but missing to document the overall processing step
* reporting letters instead of cast of characters
